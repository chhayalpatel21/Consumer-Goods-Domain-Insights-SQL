## Consumer-Goods-Domain-Insights-SQL

### Challenge Background: 
Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.
However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both skills.

As a Data Analyst I have been able to help the Atliq Hardware to gain insights through Ad-Hoc requests they made. 

### Things which I have learned from this project:
1) Using CTE's, Case statement, Windows function etc.
2) Importing database to Power BI, modelling data and creating visualization
